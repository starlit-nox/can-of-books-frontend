# Can of Books

## Logistical

**What hours will you be available to communicate?**
8AM - 6PM Mon-Fri

**What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?**
Phone, Discord

**How often will you take breaks?**
Every 4 hours

## Cooperative

**Make a list of each person’s strengths.**
Molly Porphura: CSS, HTML, JS, React.JS
Kaydee Kelly: CSS, HTML, React.JS

**How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?**
The best way we can utilize these strengths in the development of our application is by dividing the duties between one another dependent on our strengths.

**In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?**
Molly Porphura: CSS, SASS
Kaydee Kelly: React.JS, JS

**Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?**
We will work together at the same time daily as a team so we're both putting work into the application.

## Conflict Resolution

**What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?**
We will talk to that one person and see why they aren't pulling their weight and attempt to help them.

**What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?**
We will talk to that person and ask them to hang back some and/or help the individual who isn't pulling their weight or struggling.

**How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?**
We will have to approach each other with patience and understanding and pass on our knowledge to the other person to help them get to a place of understanding to resolve conflict and help raise their skill level.
