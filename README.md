Kaydee Kelly: React.JS, JS

**Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?**
We will work together at the same time daily as a team so we're both putting work into the application.

## Conflict Resolution

**What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?**
We will talk to that one person and see why they aren't pulling their weight and attempt to help them.

**What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?**
We will talk to that person and ask them to hang back some and/or help the individual who isn't pulling their weight or struggling.

**How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?**
We will have to approach each other with patience and understanding and pass on our knowledge to the other person to help them get to a place of understanding to resolve conflict and help raise their skill level.

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

The reason we are building this application is to see what books are in available and unavailable. The application will track what is and isn't in stock as well as show a list of all possible options for books. This allows users to have a simplified expereince when it comes to searching for a certain book.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
The user just has to go to the render link to access the digital library.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
The application is a website that allows users to view books that are available and unavialbe to use/brorrow. The languages used for this application is React.JS and CSS. The libraries that are being used is React-Bootstrap, Express, Reacter-Router-Dom, and Axios. To deply this application we used Render.
